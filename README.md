## Train Custom Dataset

ðŸ“š This guide explains how to train your own custom dataset with YOLOv5 ðŸš€. See YOLOv5 Docs for additional details. UPDATED 13 April 2023.

To understand the code head to this [video](https://youtu.be/HH0KresgvNc?si=ZgVRUC6PS_Wn0YjG) where i am [Describing Drowsiness Detection Android App's Code](https://youtu.be/HH0KresgvNc?si=ZgVRUC6PS_Wn0YjG).

## Before You Start
Clone repo and install requirements.txt in a Python>=3.7.0 environment, including PyTorch>=1.7. Models and datasets download automatically from the latest YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases).

```
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install
```
## Train On Custom Data
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/im/integrations-loop.png)

Creating a custom model to detect your objects is an iterative process of collecting and organizing images, labeling your objects of interest, training a model, deploying it into the wild to make predictions, and then using that deployed model to collect examples of edge cases to repeat and improve.
## 1. Create Dataset
YOLOv5 models must be trained on labelled data in order to learn classes of objects in that data. There are two options for creating your dataset before you start training:
## 1.1 Collect Images
Your model will learn by example. Training on images similar to the ones it will see in the wild is of the utmost importance. Ideally, you will collect a wide variety of images from the same configuration (camera, angle, lighting, etc.) as you will ultimately deploy your project.

If this is not possible, you can start from [a public dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics). to train your initial model and then [sample images from the wild during inference](https://blog.roboflow.com/computer-vision-active-learning-tips/?ref=ultralytics) to improve your dataset and model iteratively.
## 1.2 Create Labels
Once you have collected images, you will need to annotate the objects of interest to create a ground truth for your model to learn from.

LabelImg is a graphical image annotation tool.

It is written in Python and uses Qt for its graphical interface.

Annotations are saved as XML files in PASCAL VOC format, the format used
by [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org).  Besides, it also supports YOLO and CreateML formats.

## Installation
------------------

### Get from PyPI but only python3.0 or above

This is the simplest (one-command) install method on modern Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Fedora.

```
    pip3 install labelImg
    labelImg
    labelImg [IMAGE_PATH] [PRE-DEFINED CLASS FILE]
```

### Build from source

Linux/Ubuntu/Mac requires at least [Python
2.6](https://www.python.org/getit) and has been tested with [PyQt
4.8](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro). However, [Python3 or above](https://www.python.org/getit/) and  [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) are strongly recommended.


## Ubuntu Linux

Python 3 + Qt5

```
    sudo apt-get install pyqt5-dev-tools
    sudo pip3 install -r requirements/requirements-linux-python3.txt
    make qt5py3
    python3 labelImg.py
    python3 labelImg.py [IMAGE_PATH] [PRE-DEFINED CLASS FILE]
```
## macOS

Python 3 + Qt5

```
    brew install qt  # Install qt-5.x.x by Homebrew
    brew install libxml2

    or using pip

    pip3 install pyqt5 lxml # Install qt and lxml by pip

    make qt5py3
    python3 labelImg.py
    python3 labelImg.py [IMAGE_PATH] [PRE-DEFINED CLASS FILE]
```
## Windows

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/),
[PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5) and [install lxml](http://lxml.de/installation.html).

Open cmd and go to the [labelImg](labelimg) directory
```
    pyrcc4 -o libs/resources.py resources.qrc
    For pyqt5, pyrcc5 -o libs/resources.py resources.qrc

    python labelImg.py
    python labelImg.py [IMAGE_PATH] [PRE-DEFINED CLASS FILE]
```
You can pull the image which has all of the installed and required dependencies. [Watch a demo video](https://youtu.be/nw1GexJzbCI)


## Usage

### Steps (PascalVOC)
    1. Build and launch using the instructions above.
    2. Click 'Change default saved annotation folder' in Menu/File
    3. Click 'Open Dir'
    4. Click 'Create RectBox'
    5. Click and release left mouse to select a region to annotate the rect
    box
    6. You can use right mouse to drag the rect box to copy or move it

The annotation will be saved to the folder you specify.

You can refer to the below hotkeys to speed up your workflow.

### Steps (YOLO)


    1. In ``data/predefined_classes.txt`` define the list of classes that will be used for your training.

    2. Build and launch using the instructions above.

    3. Right below "Save" button in the toolbar, click "PascalVOC" button to switch to YOLO format.

    4. You may use Open/OpenDIR to process single or multiple images. When finished with a single image, click save.

A txt file of YOLO format will be saved in the same folder as your image with same name. A file named "classes.txt" is saved to that folder too. "classes.txt" defines the list of class names that your YOLO label refers to.

Note:

- Your label list shall not change in the middle of processing a list of images. When you save an image, classes.txt will also get updated, while previous annotations will not be updated.

- You shouldn't use "default class" function when saving to YOLO format, it will not be referred.

- When saving as YOLO format, "difficult" flag is discarded.

## 2. Select a Model

Select a pretrained model to start training from. Here we select [YOLOv5s](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/models/yolov5s.yaml), the second-smallest and fastest model available. See our README [table](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#pretrained-checkpoints) for a full comparison of all models.

## 3. Train
Train a YOLOv5s model on COCO128 by specifying dataset, batch-size, image size and either pretrained --weights yolov5s.pt (recommended), or randomly initialized --weights '' --cfg yolov5s.yaml (not recommended). Pretrained weights are auto-downloaded from the latest [YOLOv5 release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases).

```
# Train YOLOv5s on COCO128 for 3 epochs
$ python train.py --img 320  --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data dataset.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt 
```

ðŸ’¡ ProTip: Add --cache ram or --cache disk to speed up training (requires significant RAM/disk resources).

ðŸ’¡ ProTip: Always train from a local dataset. Mounted or network drives like Google Drive will be very slow.

All training results are saved to runs/train/ with incrementing run directories, i.e. runs/train/exp2, runs/train/exp3 etc. For more details see the Training section of our tutorial notebook

## Load the Custom Model
```
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'custom' , path='yolov5/runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt', force_reload= True)
```
## Testing

### Testing with folder's images
Images present in any particular folder will be tested and the result will store to the runs/detect/exp.
```
python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 320 --conf 0.25 --source runs/train/exp/test_images
```
### Testing the Model with Individual image
Images will be test on the notebook only.
```
$ img = os.path.join('data', 'images', 'awake.6ea0bcf6-0c54-11ef-bb9f-be91f5bcaf0b.jpg')
$ results = model(img)
$ results.print()
$ %matplotlib inline
$ plt.imshow(np.squeeze(results.render()))
$ plt.show()
```

## Real Time Detection
```
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    results = model(frame)
    cv2.imshow('YOLO', np.squeeze(results.render()))
    if cv2.waitKey(10) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Convert the Model into tflite Model
```
# Convert weights to fp16 TFLite model
!cd yolov5 && python export.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --include tflite --img 320
```

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yashh2417/faltu/main/yolo-to-tflite.png)

### Testing the tflite model on folder's images
```
#After running the above command, you will have best-fp16.tflite in runs\train\exp\weights folder

!cd yolov5 && python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best-fp16.tflite --img 320 --conf 0.25 --source runs/train/exp/test_images
```
results will store in runs/detect/exp.

## Android App
You must have android studio to integrate tflite Model with an Android App.

Now, download the android app's code from my [github](https://github.com/yashh2417/Android-App).
Or you can find it inside the yolov5 folder in this repository.

### Now Put TFLite models in assets folder of Android project, and change
And then open android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/detection/tflite/DetectorFactory.java

Do the following changes:

    1. Change the inputSize of image as per your dataset.

    2. Change labelFilename according to the classes of the model

    3. Then run the program in Android Studio.

## Run Android App

Go to android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/lite/examples/detection/tflite/DetectorFactory.java and press run in android studio.
